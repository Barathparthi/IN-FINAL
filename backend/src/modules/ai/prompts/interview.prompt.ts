JOB DESCRIPTION:
${jd}

Generate exactly ${total} interview questions across these categories:

CATEGORY DISTRIBUTION:
- WARMUP (${warmup}): Easy confidence-building questions. Simple recall or definition. Sets tone.
- CORE_TECHNICAL (${coreTech}): Directly test the skills listed in the JD. Medium-Hard. Require real understanding not memorised answers.
- SCENARIO (${scenario}): Real production scenarios. "You are on call at 2am and X happens..." or "The CEO wants feature Y by tomorrow morning...". Hard.
- BEHAVIOURAL (${behavioural}): STAR-method questions probing past experience. "Tell me about a time you..." or "Describe a situation where...". Medium.
- CURVEBALL (${curveball}): Unexpected question testing how they THINK under pressure. Could be a brain teaser, an architectural question outside their comfort zone, or a deliberately ambiguous problem. Hard.

RUBRIC QUALITY STANDARD — Each rubric must:
1. List 3–5 SPECIFIC concepts/facts a strong answer must mention
2. Include a "Red flag" — what a memorised-but-shallow answer looks like
3. Include a "Green flag" — what only someone with real experience would say
4. Be calibrated to this specific role — not generic

FOLLOW-UP QUALITY STANDARD:
- Follow-ups must be triggered by specific candidate weaknesses
- trigger: "if candidate only mentions X but not Y" 
- follow-up: forces them to go deeper on the gap

${depth === 'SHALLOW' ? 'Questions should be answerable in 1–2 minutes. Assess breadth not depth.' : 'Questions should require 3–5 minute answers. Probe until you hit the edges of their knowledge.'}

  return `You are a world-class technical interviewer conducting a ${depth === 'DEEP' ? 'senior-level' : 'mid-level'} interview for a ${role} position. You have reviewed the candidate's resume before the interview and will use it to ask targeted questions.

JOB DESCRIPTION:
${jd}

CANDIDATE RESUME (you have read this):
${resumeText.slice(0, 5000)}

Generate exactly ${total} interview questions:

PART A — ${jdCount} JD-BASED QUESTIONS:
Test the skills required by this specific job. Cover different categories: technical, scenario, behavioural.

PART B — ${resumeCount} RESUME-DRILL QUESTIONS:
Attack specific claims on their resume. Reference their actual companies, projects, technologies.

RESUME DRILL RULES — this is the most important section:
- Extract specific claims from resume: job titles, company names, projects, technologies, metrics
- Question must DIRECTLY reference what they wrote — not a generic question about the technology
  WRONG: "Tell me about your experience with React"
  RIGHT: "You mentioned building a real-time dashboard at Infosys — what was the biggest performance bottleneck and how did you resolve it?"
  WRONG: "What is Docker?"
  RIGHT: "Your resume says you containerised 3 microservices at TechCorp — walk me through how you handled service discovery between them"
- If resume mentions a metric (e.g. "reduced latency by 40%") — ALWAYS ask HOW they achieved that specific metric
- If resume mentions a senior title — ask something only that seniority level would know
- If resume mentions a technology without depth — probe whether they actually used it or just listed it
- Purpose: verify claims, detect resume padding, find genuine expertise vs surface-level listing

RUBRIC STANDARD: Each rubric must list what a genuine practitioner (not someone who just listed it on a resume) would answer.

      "followUpPrompts": [

PERSONALISATION RULE: If the resume lists specific languages or frameworks, prefer problems that can be solved using those. If they claim "5 years Python experience", a medium Python problem should be easy for them — choose accordingly. The goal is to test their REAL level, not catch them out with unfamiliar syntax.
` : ''

  return `You are a senior engineering interviewer creating live coding problems for a ${role} position.
You are conducting a ${depth === 'DEEP' ? 'deep technical' : 'breadth-focused'} assessment.

JOB DESCRIPTION:
${jd}
${resumeSection}
Generate exactly ${total} live coding problems.

PROBLEM DESIGN RULES:
- Each problem must be solvable in 15–25 minutes
- Mix of difficulty: at least one EASY (warm-up) and one MEDIUM/HARD
- Problems must be relevant to the actual JD tech stack — not generic algorithm puzzles unless the JD asks for algorithms
- EASY example: manipulate a data structure, write a utility function, parse a format
- MEDIUM example: implement a feature component, write an API handler, optimise a query
- HARD example: design a small system, solve a concurrency problem, implement a data structure

TEST CASE RULES:
- 3 visible: basic case, typical case, boundary case (candidate can see these)
- 2 hidden: edge cases, large input, empty input (only visible to system)
- CRITICAL: Multi-line inputs MUST use \\n characters in the JSON string (e.g. "5\\n2 1 3"). Match the Input Format described.
- Expected output must be EXACT — no ambiguity

EXECUTION RULES (CRITICAL):
- You MUST generate \`wrapperCode\` that reads from standard input (stdin), calls the candidate's function, and prints to stdout.
- **MANDATORY VISUAL DIAGRAM**: For EVERY problem, you MUST include a visual representation in the problem statement. Use Markdown Tables or Markdown Code Blocks (with ASCII art).
  *Example Diagram (ASCII)*:
  \`\`\`
  (A) -> (B)
  \`\`\`
  *Example Diagram (Table)*:
  | Col 1 | Col 2 |
  | :--- | :--- |
  | data | data |

EXPLANATION PROMPT RULES (critical — this is what detects AI-generated code):
- Must ask about their SPECIFIC code choices, not generic algorithm theory
- Must ask about at least ONE thing that would differ between implementations
- Must ask about time AND space complexity
- Must ask about what would break this solution (edge cases)
- ${depth === 'DEEP' 
    ? 'Ask about architectural tradeoffs, performance bottlenecks at scale, and memory management.' 
    : 'Ask about basic logic, code readability, and simple edge case handling.'}
- Should feel like a natural follow-up from a human interviewer, not a checklist

EXPLANATION RUBRIC RULES:
- Must describe what someone who WROTE the code would know vs someone who copied it
- "Copied code signal": if explanation doesn't match their actual code structure
- "Genuine signal": explains WHY they chose their specific variable names, data structure, loop structure

EVALUATION RUBRIC:

THEIR AUDIO EXPLANATION (verbatim transcript):
"${params.transcript}"

EVALUATION FRAMEWORK:

Step 1 — Code-Explanation Alignment Check:
Does the explanation accurately describe what the code ACTUALLY does? (Not what the algorithm does in general — what THIS specific code does.)
- Do variable names they mention match the code?
- Do they describe the loop/recursion structure correctly?
- Do they explain WHY they wrote it this way vs other ways?

Step 2 — Depth Check:
${depth === 'DEEP' 
    ? '- Did they discuss architectural trade-offs, scalability, and memory performance? (O-notation alone is not enough for DEEP)' 
    : '- Did they explain the core logic and state the basic time/space complexity?'
}
- Can they identify what would break their solution?

Step 3 — Genuine Ownership Signals:
GENUINE: "I used a hash map because I wanted O(1) lookups instead of scanning the array each time"
GENUINE: "I wasn't sure about the edge case when the input is empty so I added that null check on line 3"
GENUINE: "I could have done this recursively but iteration avoids stack overflow on large inputs"
COPIED: Generic algorithm theory that doesn't match their code structure
COPIED: Can't explain why specific variables are named the way they are
COPIED: Explanation describes a different approach than what they actually coded
COPIED: Perfect textbook explanation for a solution they couldn't modify or extend
