Generate exactly ${total} behavioural MCQs: ${easy} EASY, ${medium} MEDIUM, ${hard} HARD.

ASSESS THESE DIMENSIONS:
- Ownership and accountability
- Communication clarity

- Adaptability and learning agility
- Integrity and decision making under pressure

QUESTION RULES:
1. Every question must be scenario-based, not definition-based.
2. Each option must be realistic and plausible in workplace context.
3. Only one option should be best aligned with strong professional behaviour.
4. Distractors should represent common but weaker behaviours.
5. Keep stems concise (2-4 sentences) with clear context.
6. Distribute the correct option position fairly across A/B/C/D. Do not keep one fixed position.

  return `You are a senior technical interviewer designing placement-drive MCQs for a ${role} position, similar to TCS NQT, Infosys Specialist, and Wipro Elite technical tests.

JOB DESCRIPTION:
${jd}

Generate exactly ${total} technical MCQs: ${easy} EASY, ${medium} MEDIUM, ${hard} HARD.

DIFFICULTY STANDARDS — TCS/Infosys style:
- EASY: Tests understanding of a concept but with a small twist. NOT pure definition questions. Candidate must think, not just recall. Example: "What is the output of this 4-line code snippet?" or "Which of the following is NOT a valid use of X?"
- MEDIUM: Code output prediction, edge case identification, concept application in a scenario. Options are close to each other — one common mistake leads to a wrong option. Time pressure matters.
- HARD: Multi-concept questions. Debugging a code snippet with a subtle bug. System design tradeoffs. Time complexity analysis with a twist. "What happens when..." scenario questions where 2 options seem correct but one has a subtle flaw.

QUESTION STYLE RULES — every question must follow:
1. NO pure definition questions ("What does X stand for?", "Which of these is a feature of Y?") — these are too easy and test nothing
2. Every question must require the candidate to THINK or APPLY — not just recall
3. Options must be designed to trap common mistakes:
   - One option is the most common wrong answer (plausible distractor)
   - One option is partially correct but misses a key detail
   - One option is clearly wrong only if you know the concept deeply
   - One option is correct
4. For code-based questions: show actual code snippets (4-8 lines), ask for output or identify the bug
5. For concept questions: frame as a real scenario, not an abstract definition
6. Use domain-specific terminology from the JD
7. Stem should be 2-4 sentences — enough context to require thinking
8. Distribute the correct option position fairly across A/B/C/D. Do not keep one fixed position.

TOPICS TO COVER — extract from JD and test:
- Language/framework specific behaviour (gotchas, edge cases)
- Time/space complexity analysis
- Design pattern application
- Common bugs and their symptoms
- Real-world tradeoffs (when to use X vs Y)

${topicInstruction}

TCS/AMCAT DIFFICULTY STANDARDS:
- EASY: Requires formula application but numbers are designed to trap careless errors. Example: "A train 150m long passes a pole in 15 seconds. How long will it take to pass a platform 100m long?" — looks easy but candidates often forget to add platform length.
- MEDIUM: Two to three steps, time pressure matters. Hidden conditions in the problem. Example: "Two pipes fill a tank in 12 and 15 hours respectively. A third pipe drains it in 10 hours. If all three are opened simultaneously, in how many hours will the tank be full?" — requires careful sign handling.
- HARD: Multi-step with a twist. Conditional logic. Example: "A and B together complete a work in 8 days. B and C together in 12 days. A and C together in 16 days. In how many days will A, B and C together complete the work? If A works alone for 4 days and then B joins, how many more days to finish?"

QUESTION DESIGN RULES:
1. NEVER ask simple formula-plug questions where any student who memorised the formula gets it right in 5 seconds
2. Every problem must have at least one trap — a condition that changes if you read carelessly
3. Options must include:
   - The correct answer
   - The answer you get if you forget one condition (most common mistake)
   - The answer you get if you use the wrong formula variant
   - A completely wrong but plausible-looking value
4. Numbers should NOT be round numbers — use values like 37.5%, 14 days, 7/11 to make calculation non-trivial
5. Word problems must have realistic business/life context (trains, workers, shops, investments)
6. For logical series: use non-obvious patterns (alternating, difference of differences, prime-based)
7. For blood relations: minimum 4 people with at least 2 relationships to resolve
8. For seating: minimum 5 people with conditional constraints
9. Explanation must show step-by-step working with the ACTUAL calculation
10. Distribute the correct option position fairly across A/B/C/D. Do not keep one fixed position.
